# Data Structure — Master Schedule Builder

## Parents

Three entities that stand on their own. They don't belong to anything else.

1. **Student**
2. **Teacher**
3. **Room**

## Shared Resources

Used by multiple parents. They don't own anything — parents get placed into them.

1. **Cohort** — a group of Students (e.g., LEO Cohort A)
2. **Term** — a time block: FY, S1, S2
3. **Period** — a time slot in the bell schedule: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

## Course Code

A shared link that connects Students, Teachers, and Rooms. A course code is not a parent — it is something that gets attached to all three parents.

## Section

The meeting point where a Student, Teacher, and Room come together at a specific Period + Term. A course code can have more than one section.

## Data Rules

- **Prescribed** = input. The principal decided before the build. The engine must respect it.
- **Assigned** = output. The engine decided during the build.
- **Null** = no data applies. The field intentionally has no value. The engine must select the least restrictive option.
- **Blank** = error. The user missed a field.

## Parent Data Inputs

### Student

| Field | Values | Null Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Student > ID Number | unique ID (e.g., 106245) | not allowed — every student has an ID |
| Student > Grade Level | 9, 10, 11, 12 | not allowed — every student has a grade |
| Student > Grade Level Priority Score | calculated from grade level | not allowed |

### Teacher

(to be defined)

### Room

Room ID is the room number (e.g., S-234). This is both the identifier and the name. No separate RM_ prefix ID — one clean code.

| Field | Values | Null Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Room > Room ID | room number (e.g., S-234) | not allowed — every room has an ID |
| Room > Prescribed Room > Course Code | course code | null — room not locked to a course |
| Room > Unavailable Rooms > Course Code | list of room numbers | null — no rooms excluded |

**Don Bosco Prep vs. Commercial Product:**

- **Don Bosco Prep (now):** The principal prescribes which room a course uses, or provides a list of rooms that CANNOT be used. The engine works with what's left. No department matching needed.
- **Commercial Product (future):** Room > Department field will be added so the engine can automatically match rooms to courses and teachers by department. A new school won't have to prescribe every room manually.

## Pre-Build Validation Sources

### Student Course Request Checks

The engine needs to validate course requests before the build runs. This requires data from multiple sources:

| Check | Sources Needed |
|-------|---------------|
| Total credits within cap (35) | Student > Course Request > Course Code + Course Code > Credits |
| Duplicate requests in current year | Student > Course Request > Course Code (check for repeats within same student) |
| Already completed in previous year | Student > Course Request > Course Code + Historical Grades (same course code with Pass) |
| Prerequisites met | Student > Course Request > Course Code + Course Code > Prerequisite > Course Code + Historical Grades |
| Avoid failed-course teacher | Historical Grades (failed course + section) + Prior Year Master Schedule (section + teacher) |

### Historical Grades File

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Student ID | match to Student > ID Number |
| School Year | which year (23-24, 24-25, 25-26) |
| Course Code | clean, standalone column — NOT embedded in a combined string |
| Section | needed to cross-reference teacher from prior year master schedule |
| Final Grade | the grade earned |
| Pass/Fail | clear yes/no — did the student complete this course |

### Prior Year Master Schedule

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| School Year | which year |
| Course Code | match to historical grades |
| Section | match to historical grades — this is the link between the two files |
| Teacher ID | who taught this section |
| Room | where this section met |

The engine cross-references these two files using Course Code + Section to connect a student's grade to the teacher and room from that year.

## Course Code Relationships

The same course code can appear under multiple parents:

| Relationship | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| Student > Course Code | this student is requesting this course |
| Teacher > Course Code | this teacher is prescribed to teach this course |
| Room > Course Code | this room is prescribed for this course |

---

## Section Structure

A section is built under a course code. The engine attaches parents and shared resources to it.

```
Course Code > Section > Student    (engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Teacher    (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Room       (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Period     (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Term       (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Cohort     (prescribed or null)
```

A section occupies a **time slot** = Period + Term pair.

Example — Course 849 (Catholic Social Teaching), 8 sections:

```
849 > Section 1 > Teacher = New THEO 2 Teacher
849 > Section 1 > Room    = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 1 > Period  = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 1 > Term    = S1
849 > Section 1 > Students = (engine assigns)

849 > Section 5 > Teacher = New THEO 2 Teacher
849 > Section 5 > Room    = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 5 > Period  = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 5 > Term    = S2
849 > Section 5 > Students = (engine assigns)
```

## Prescribed Relationships

Any parent can be prescribed to any shared resource or course code. If not prescribed, the value is null and the engine decides.

### Student Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Student > Course Code | course code (e.g., 745) | not applicable — requests always have a code |

### Teacher Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Teacher > Prescribed Course > Course Code | course code (e.g., 745) | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Room > Teacher ID | room number (e.g., S-234) | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Term > Teacher ID | FY, S1, S2 | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Period > Teacher ID | A, B, C, D, E, F, G | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Cohort > Teacher ID | cohort name (e.g., LEO Cohort A) | engine selects least restrictive |

### Room Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Room > Prescribed Course > Course Code | course code (e.g., 745) | engine selects least restrictive |

### Course Code Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Course Code > Prescribed Teacher | teacher ID/name | engine selects least restrictive |
| Course Code > Prescribed Room | room number | engine selects least restrictive |
| Course Code > Prescribed Term | FY, S1, S2 | engine selects least restrictive |
| Course Code > Prescribed Period | A, B, C, D, E, F, G | engine selects least restrictive |
