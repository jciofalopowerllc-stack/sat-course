# Data Structure — Master Schedule Builder

## Parents

Three entities that stand on their own. They don't belong to anything else.

1. **Student**
2. **Teacher**
3. **Room**

## Shared Resources

Used by multiple parents. They don't own anything — parents get placed into them.

1. **Cohort** — a group of Students (e.g., LEO Cohort A)
2. **Term** — a time block: FY, S1, S2
3. **Period** — a time slot in the bell schedule: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

## Course Code

A shared link that connects Students, Teachers, and Rooms. A course code is not a parent — it is something that gets attached to all three parents.

## Section

The meeting point where a Student, Teacher, and Room come together at a specific Period + Term. A course code can have more than one section.

## Data Rules

- **Prescribed** = input. The principal decided before the build. The engine must respect it.
- **Assigned** = output. The engine decided during the build.
- **Null** = no data applies. The field intentionally has no value. The engine must select the least restrictive option.
- **Blank** = error. The user missed a field.

## Parent Data Inputs

### Student

| Field | Values | Null Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Student > ID Number | unique ID (e.g., 106245) | not allowed — every student has an ID |
| Student > Grade Level | 9, 10, 11, 12 | not allowed — every student has a grade |
| Student > Grade Level Priority Score | calculated from grade level | not allowed |

### Teacher

(to be defined)

### Room

(to be defined)

## Course Code Relationships

The same course code can appear under multiple parents:

| Relationship | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| Student > Course Code | this student is requesting this course |
| Teacher > Course Code | this teacher is prescribed to teach this course |
| Room > Course Code | this room is prescribed for this course |

---

## Section Structure

A section is built under a course code. The engine attaches parents and shared resources to it.

```
Course Code > Section > Student    (engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Teacher    (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Room       (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Period     (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Term       (prescribed or engine assigns)
Course Code > Section > Cohort     (prescribed or null)
```

A section occupies a **time slot** = Period + Term pair.

Example — Course 849 (Catholic Social Teaching), 8 sections:

```
849 > Section 1 > Teacher = New THEO 2 Teacher
849 > Section 1 > Room    = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 1 > Period  = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 1 > Term    = S1
849 > Section 1 > Students = (engine assigns)

849 > Section 5 > Teacher = New THEO 2 Teacher
849 > Section 5 > Room    = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 5 > Period  = (engine assigns)
849 > Section 5 > Term    = S2
849 > Section 5 > Students = (engine assigns)
```

## Prescribed Relationships

Any parent can be prescribed to any shared resource or course code. If not prescribed, the value is null and the engine decides.

### Student Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Student > Course Code | course code (e.g., 745) | not applicable — requests always have a code |

### Teacher Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Teacher > Prescribed Course > Course Code | course code (e.g., 745) | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Room > Teacher ID | room number (e.g., S-234) | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Term > Teacher ID | FY, S1, S2 | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Period > Teacher ID | A, B, C, D, E, F, G | engine selects least restrictive |
| Teacher > Prescribed Cohort > Teacher ID | cohort name (e.g., LEO Cohort A) | engine selects least restrictive |

### Room Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Room > Prescribed Course > Course Code | course code (e.g., 745) | engine selects least restrictive |

### Course Code Prescriptions

| Relationship | Values | Null |
|-------------|--------|------|
| Course Code > Prescribed Teacher | teacher ID/name | engine selects least restrictive |
| Course Code > Prescribed Room | room number | engine selects least restrictive |
| Course Code > Prescribed Term | FY, S1, S2 | engine selects least restrictive |
| Course Code > Prescribed Period | A, B, C, D, E, F, G | engine selects least restrictive |
